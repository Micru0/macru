      "taskTitle": "Set up project foundation and authentication",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project foundation and authentication setup into logical phases, focusing on separating the Next.js setup, Supabase configuration, authentication flows, and UI component creation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Supabase) and requires both frontend and backend work. The authentication implementation includes several flows and security considerations. The task has 9 detailed steps that can be logically grouped into setup, authentication, and UI components."

      "taskTitle": "Implement file upload and storage system",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the file upload and storage system implementation into distinct components: Supabase Storage setup, frontend upload interface, file management operations, and security/validation features.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing both frontend components and backend storage. It involves handling file validation, progress tracking, and database operations. The complexity comes from managing the upload process, error handling, and ensuring proper security policies."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Build document processing and ingestion pipeline",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the document processing pipeline into logical stages: file extraction, text processing, database setup, embedding generation, storage implementation, and optimization/error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This is a complex task involving multiple processing steps (extraction, chunking, embedding) and requires setting up vector database capabilities. It handles different file types and needs to be optimized for performance. The integration with external embedding services adds another layer of complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement LLM router and integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the LLM router implementation into core components: API integration architecture, Gemini-specific implementation, security features, UI components, and advanced features like streaming and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating an abstraction layer for LLM services with specific implementation for Gemini. It involves API security, streaming responses, and error handling. The complexity comes from designing a flexible system that can support multiple providers while maintaining consistent behavior."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop query interface and response display",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the query interface development into: input component creation, conversation history management, response display with formatting, and state management for loading and errors.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on frontend development with several UI components that need to work together. It requires state management for conversation history and loading states. The complexity is moderate as it's primarily UI work, but needs to handle various states and formatting requirements."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) querying system",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the CAG system implementation into distinct components: API endpoint creation, vector search implementation, context assembly logic, prompt engineering, caching system, source attribution, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it represents the core RAG functionality. It involves vector search, context assembly within token limits, prompt engineering, and caching. The task requires deep integration between database, vector search, and LLM components while maintaining performance."

    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Modular Memory Layer (MEM0)",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the memory layer implementation into: database schema design, encryption system, memory operations (CRUD), context integration logic, UI components, and automatic memory management features.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a sophisticated memory system with encryption, database operations, and integration with the LLM context. The complexity comes from designing a flexible memory structure, ensuring security through encryption, and creating logic to effectively use memory in queries."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement first external data connector (Notion)",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Notion connector implementation into: connector architecture design, OAuth implementation, data fetching and transformation, ingestion pipeline integration, and UI components for management.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating both a general connector architecture and a specific Notion implementation. It involves OAuth authentication, API integration, and content transformation. The complexity comes from designing a flexible system that can be extended to other platforms while handling Notion's specific requirements."

    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Action Execution Layer",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the action execution layer into: action proposal system, confirmation UI, execution logic, security features, logging system, and settings management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a sophisticated system for LLM-proposed actions with security considerations. It requires careful design of confirmation flows, execution logic, and error handling. The complexity comes from ensuring security while maintaining usability, with logging and rollback capabilities."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the settings management implementation into: core settings architecture, UI components for different setting categories, responsive design improvements, and onboarding/error handling enhancements.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on creating a comprehensive settings system and polishing the application. While it touches many parts of the application, each component is relatively straightforward. The complexity comes from ensuring consistency across different settings areas and implementing responsive design."
