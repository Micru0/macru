This is a sample text file for testing the text extraction service.

It contains multiple paragraphs to test paragraph handling.

This paragraph has multiple sentences. It should be properly extracted. The text cleaner should maintain this structure.

Here's a list of items:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And some numbers:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

The extractor should maintain spaces and basic formatting while removing excessive whitespace.



This paragraph comes after multiple empty lines, which should be normalized by the cleaner.
